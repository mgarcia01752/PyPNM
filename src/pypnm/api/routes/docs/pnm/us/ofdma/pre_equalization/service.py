class CmUsOfdmaPreEqService(CommonMeasureService):
    """
    Service for performing Upstream OFDMA Pre-Equalization analysis on a DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem.

    This class initiates a PNM (Proactive Network Maintenance) test to collect and analyze
    pre-equalization coefficients from the upstream OFDMA channel. The collected data helps
    diagnose issues such as group delay, in-channel frequency response (ICFR) impairments,
    or common path distortions (CPD).

    Attributes:
        cable_modem (CableModem): The target cable modem instance for the test.
        tftp_servers (Tuple[Inet, Inet]): Tuple of primary and secondary TFTP servers used
            for file transfers during test execution.
        tftp_path (str): The remote TFTP path where result files will be stored.
        logger (logging.Logger): Logger instance for service-level logging and diagnostics.

    Inherits:
        CommonMeasureService: Provides core functionality for initiating tests,
        retrieving results, and performing SNMP or file-based operations.
