            connection.   
            A row is created by the operator or by the agent if the PW 
            is created by non-SNMP application or due to autodiscovery 
            process.  
            None of the read-create objects values can be changed   
            when teaPwRowStatus is in the active(1) state. Changes are 
            allowed when the teaPwRowStatus is in notInService(2) or  
            notReady(3) states only.   
            If the operator need to change one of the values for an  
            active row (i.e. in order to fix a mismatch in  
            configuration between the local node and the peer), the  
            teaPwRowStatus should be first changed to notInService(2), 
            the objects may be changed now, and later to active(1)   
            in order to re-initiate the signaling process with the  
            new values in effect.
