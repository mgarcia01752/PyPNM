  DESCRIPTION
    "Initial version of this MIB module. It defines the objects
    used to remote configure, monitor, and diagnose the
    Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) network. The following
    Specifications are referenced in this MIB definition,
    1. MoCA MAC/PHY Specification v2.0, November 21, 2013.
    2. MoCA MAC/PHY Specification v1.1, June 27, 2011.
    3. MoCA MAC/PHY Specification v1.0, July 1, 2009.
    The key changes from the MoCA 1.1 MIB in this revision are,
    a. Updated the mocaConfigTable and associated objects.
    b. Added the mocaRlapmTable and associated objects.
    c. Added the mocaSapmTable and associated objects.
    d. Added the mocaAcaTable and associated objects.
    e. Added the mocaMrTable and associated objects.
    f. Updated the mocaStatusTable and associated objects.
    g. Updated the mocaStatsTable and associated objects.
    h. Updated the mocaFlowStatsTable and associated objects.
    i. Updated the mocaLinkStatsTable and associated objects.
    j. Updated the mocaNodeTable and associated objects.
    k. Added mocaMeshTxRateNper and mocaMeshTxRateVlper objects
       in mocaMeshTable.
    l. Updated mocaMeshScModTable and associated objects.
    m. Updated mocaNotifications and associated objects."
