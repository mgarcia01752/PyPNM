    DESCRIPTION
           "Initial revision, published as RFC 5017.

            Copyright (C) The IETF Trust (2007).  This version of this
            MIB module is part of RFC 5017; see the RFC itself for full
            legal notices."

Uri ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   DISPLAY-HINT "1a"
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
            "A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as defined by STD 66.

            Objects using this TEXTUAL-CONVENTION MUST be in US-ASCII
            encoding, and MUST be normalized as described by RFC 3986
            Sections 6.2.1, 6.2.2.1, and 6.2.2.2.  All unnecessary
            percent-encoding is removed, and all case-insensitive
            characters are set to lowercase except for hexadecimal
            digits, which are normalized to uppercase as described in
            Section 6.2.2.1.

            The purpose of this normalization is to help provide unique
            URIs.  Note that this normalization is not sufficient to
            provide uniqueness.  Two URIs that are textually distinct
            after this normalization may still be equivalent.

            Objects using this TEXTUAL-CONVENTION MAY restrict the
            schemes that they permit.  For example, 'data:' and 'urn:'
            schemes might not be appropriate.

            A zero-length URI is not a valid URI.  This can be used to
            express 'URI absent' where required, for example when used
            as an index field.

            Where this TEXTUAL-CONVENTION is used for an index field,
            it MUST be subtyped to restrict its length.  There is an
            absolute limit of 128 subids for an OID, and it is not
            efficient to have OIDs whose length approaches this
            limit."
