# DOCSIS Downstream Histogram API

This API initiates and retrieves DOCSIS Downstream Histogram measurements from a cable modem. The histogram provides insights into nonlinear channel effects such as amplifier compression and laser clipping.

## Purpose

The downstream histogram provides a measurement of nonlinear effects in the downstream DOCSIS channel, such as:

- **Amplifier Compression**
- **Laser Clipping**: Often characterized by one-sided truncation and a sharp spike in the histogram.

The cable modem (CM) captures a histogram of time-domain samples from the wideband front end of the receiver across the full downstream band. This two-sided histogram represents values from far-negative to far-positive sample amplitudes.

The histogram data includes:
- **Bin Count**: 255 or 256 equally spaced bins (typically from the 8 MSBs of the ADC).
- **Dwell Count (per bin)**: Number of samples observed per bin (typically constant across bins).
- **Hit Count (per bin)**: Number of samples falling into each specific bin.

Each histogram run accumulates samples over time, terminating upon:
- Manual restart
- Timeout
- Histogram disable command
- 32-bit overflow of the dwell counter

## Error Responses

### HTTP 500

* **Downstream Histogram SNMP execution failed**
  The modem failed to begin measurement or complete it properly.

* **Measurement retrieval failed: \[error message]**
  Generic failure, including file retrieval or processing issues.

---

## Behavior and Timing Notes

* Histogram typically completes in **30 seconds or less** for a dwell of **10 million samples**.
* Histogram continues accumulating samples until:

  * Disabled manually
  * Timeout occurs
  * Measurement restarted
  * Dwell count overflows (32-bit limit)

---

## Dependencies

* **SNMP Access** to `docsPnmCmDsHist*` MIB entries
* **TFTP Server** for retrieving measurement data files

---

## Logging

* Logs MAC, IP, duration, and internal processing status
* Exceptions are logged with detailed stack traces for troubleshooting

---

## Related Components

* **Router Class**: `DsHistogramRouter`
* **Service Class**: `CmDsHistogramService`
* **Schema Classes**: `PnmHistogramRequest`, `PnmHistogramResponse`

---

## Example Use Case

A CMTS operator notices increased downstream packet loss and distortion. By running this histogram API, they identify a clipped histogram tail â€” likely caused by laser clipping â€” and can take corrective action (e.g., adjusting optical power levels or replacing faulty hardware).
