## Workflow Overview

1. **Start Capture** (`POST /advance/multiRxMer/start`)

   * Initiates a background RxMER capture session with a defined duration and sample interval.
   * Returns a `group_id` and `operation_id` that uniquely identify this capture workflow.

2. **Check Status** (`GET /advance/multiRxMer/status/{operation_id}`)

   * Polls the session state to retrieve how many samples have been collected and the remaining time.

3. **Download Results** (`GET /advance/multiRxMer/results/{operation_id}`)

   * Streams a ZIP archive of all captured PNM files for offline processing or archival.

4. **Stop Capture Early** (`DELETE /advance/multiRxMer/stop/{operation_id}`)

   * Signals the capture task to end after the current iteration.
   * Returns the final sample count and state (including any time remaining).

5. **Analysis** (`POST /advance/multiRxMer/analysis`)

   * Submits an `operation_id` and desired `analysis_type` to perform post-capture analytics.
   * Returns processed metrics (e.g., min/avg/max RxMER, heatmaps, or profile performance).

## Endpoint Stubs

### 1. Start Capture

**Note:** Choose the appropriate measure mode according to desired capture type:

* `mode = 0` for **continuous sampling** (needed for MIN\_AVG\_MAX and RXMER\_HEAT\_MAP analyses).

* If **OFDM analysis** measure mode (mode = 1) was used, you can request:

  * `OFDM_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE` (analysis\_type = 1)

**Request** (`MultiRxMerAnalysisRequest` schema):

```json
{
  "mac_address": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff",

## Timing Details

### 1. Start Capture Timing

* **`measurement_duration`** (in seconds) defines how long the background task will run.

  * Example: `measurement_duration: 60` means sampling will occur for one minute total.
* **`sample_interval`** (in seconds) specifies how frequently a new RxMER measurement is taken.

  * Example: if `sample_interval: 10`, then 6 samples will be taken over a 60-second duration.
* Once you call `POST /advance/multiRxMer/start`, the API immediately returns a `group_id` and `operation_id`, and the background thread begins waiting for the first sample.

### 2. Status Polling Recommendations

* Clients should query `GET /advance/multiRxMer/status/{operation_id}` only as often as necessary.
* **Recommended Poll Interval:**

  * At most once every `sample_interval` seconds (e.g., if `sample_interval = 10`, poll every 10 seconds).
  * Polling more frequently wastes resources; polling less frequently risks missing the ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù transition.
* Each status response includes `time_remaining` (seconds). When `time_remaining == 0` and `state` changes to `"completed"`, no further polling is needed.

### 3. Download Results Timing

* Once a capture has `state: "completed"` or `"stopped"`, the ZIP archive is available instantly.
* The download speed depends on network bandwidth and the total PNM file size.
* Internal note: each PNM file is generated at the moment of sampling (asynchronously), so the archive simply bundles existing files; there is no additional processing delay.

### 4. Stop Capture Early Timing

* When `DELETE /advance/multiRxMer/stop/{operation_id}` is called:

  1. The background thread completes its current sampling iteration (if mid-sample).
  2. It writes the final PNM file for that iteration.
  3. It transitions `operation.state` to `"stopped"`.
* As a result, the reported `operation.time_remaining` may be slightly greater than zero if you stop mid-interval.
* Expected delay: up to `sample_interval` seconds before the capture thread acknowledges the stop and returns status.

### 5. Analysis Processing Time

* **MIN\_AVG\_MAX** (analysis\_type = 0):

  * Complexity: O(N) over the number of collected samples N.
  * On a 60-second run with 6 samples, processing completes in a few milliseconds.
* **OFDM\_PROFILE\_PERFORMANCE** (analysis\_type = 1):

  * Complexity: O(N √ó M) where M = number of subcarriers (e.g., 192 subcarriers for a 6 MHz OFDM channel).
  * Typical delay: under 100 ms for 6 samples √ó 192 subcarriers.
* **RXMER\_HEAT\_MAP** (analysis\_type = 2):

  * Complexity: O(N √ó M) to build the 2D array plus potential image rendering if returned as a graphic.
  * Typical delay: under 200 ms for moderate sample counts (<100) and standard channel widths.
* These are rough estimates‚Äîactual latency depends on server load and I/O.
* Clients should expect analysis responses to be nearly instantaneous (sub-second) for typical downstream-ofdm captures.
